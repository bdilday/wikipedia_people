# wikipedia_people

A Python script to collect data on influential people from wikipedia. The purpose is to programatically generate a data set similatr to the one used in this Wait But Why blog post (horizontal history):
 http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html

 Currently it collects length of a persons wikipedia entry, the number of links that point to their page, and the year of their demise. A possible next step is to parse the categories in more detail, i.e. artist, scientist, politician, etc... or to apply PageRank, similar to this http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7183
