# wikipedia_people

A Python script to collect data on influential people from wikipedia. The purpose is to programatically generate a data set similatr to the one used in this Wait But Why blog post (horizontal history):
 http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html

 Currently it collects length of a persons wikipedia entry and the number of links that point to their page. The next step will be to trim the list based on these metrics, and then query for additional information.
